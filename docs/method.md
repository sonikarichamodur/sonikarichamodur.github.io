### Step 1: Obtain dataset
- 8124 instances of mushroom data
- 48% poisonous, 52% nonpoisonous
- 22 attributes
- 23 features 
### Step 2: Data preprocessing

- Handling missing data (imputation) 
- Encoding categorical data (one-hot encoding)
- Splitting data into training and test set (80:20)
- Feature scaling (standardization)

### Step 3: Train binary classifiers

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

### Step 4: Evaluate classification models performance

- Confusion matrices for each binary classifier

### Step 5: Conduct clustering anlaysis

- k-means clustering
