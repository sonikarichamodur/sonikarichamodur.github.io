    <h1>Toxicity detection in gilled mushrooms using machine learning</h1>
    <h2>Sonika Modur</h2>
 
    <h2>The goals with this research are to:</h2> 
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Build a **binary classifier** that can take the attributes of a mushroom as input and output 
                whether the mushroom contains toxic chemicals or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use **clustering analysis** to identify combinations of mushroom attributes that are 
                more likely to indicate toxicity.
            </li>
            <li>
                This research has impacts in cutting-edge pharmacology and saving lives by helping poison control centers
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Pharmacology:</h2> 
        Due to its anticancer properties and prevalence in alternative medicine, pharmacologists are working to **extract beta glucans from nontoxic gilled mushrooms to develop modern medicine**. Pharmacologists are on the lookout for species of gilled mushrooms whose beta glucans are more easy to extract, and a mushroom toxicity classifier could help them narrow their research when exploring the estimated _2-3 million unidentified mushroom species._

        <h2>Poison Control:</h2> 
        A vast majority of the human population fervently forage for gilled mushrooms due to its valuable medicinal properties, albeit the formidable toxicity risks.
        **Identifying the existence of toxic chemicals in gilled mushrooms is difficult for humans, as there are no rules of thumb to abide by.** Therefore, _machine learning models_ for determining the presence of toxic chemicals in Agaricaceae fungi are at the verge of becoming an indispensable tool for poison control centers
