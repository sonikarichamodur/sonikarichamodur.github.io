I am a student researcher and an avid reader. Outside of academics, I love to garden. The many mushrooms I have spotted in my gardening endeavors make me a strong believer of using mushrooms to their fullest potential. They are a resource so abundantly available right in our backyards!

For those who are curious, my favorite mushrooms are baby bella and portobello. Rest assured, both are nontoxic. 

Feel free to message me on GitHub @sonikarichamodur about anything related to my research work.
