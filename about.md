I am a student researcher and an avid reader. Outside of academics, I love to garden. The many mushrooms I have spotted in my gardening endeavors make me a strong believer of using mushrooms to their fullest potential. They are a resource so abundantly available right in our backyards!

For those who are curious, my favorite mushrooms are baby bella and portobello. Rest assured, both are nontoxic.
