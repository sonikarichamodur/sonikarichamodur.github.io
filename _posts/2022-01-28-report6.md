I conducted a Zoom meeting with Dr. Asha Gowda, Associate Professor at Siddaganga Institute of Technology, which is in Karnataka, India.

Dr. Gowda had conducted machine learning research on identifying edible and toxic mushrooms, and she has expertise in computer science, information systems, and data mining. 

<b>I had contacted her to gain further insight on my next stage of clustering analysis.</b>

<b>Important points discussed were: </b>

- Dr. Gowda stated that the <b>k-means clustering algorithm</b>, which was the clustering analysis algorithm I had originally chosen in my experimental design, <b>cannot be implemented on my dataset</b>. This is because the k-means algorithm is only used on continuous data, and this data set lacks numerical values. 

- The alternative algorithm Dr. Gowda proposed was the <b>k-modes</b> algorithm,
