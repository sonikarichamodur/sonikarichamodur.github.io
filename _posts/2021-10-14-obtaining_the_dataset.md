## The dataset used is from **UCI** (University of California, Irvine) **Machine Learning Repository**.

{: .box-note}
**Note:** The dataset was publicly available.

The dataset has 8124 instances of gilled mushroom (Agaricacae fungi) data, where there are 22 attributes for each instance (apart from using toxicity as the dependent variable vector).

## The attributes are:
- cap shape
- cap surface
- cap color
- bruises
- odor
- gill attachment
- gill spacing
- gill size
- gill color
- stalk shape
- stalk root
- stalk surface above ring
- stalk surface below ring
- stalk color above ring
- stalk color below ring
- veil type
- veil color
- ring number
- ring type
- spore print color
- population
- habitat

The mushrooms in the dataset can be split into two essentially balanced classes: 48% of the mushroom samples are poisonous and 52% of the mushroom samples are edible.
