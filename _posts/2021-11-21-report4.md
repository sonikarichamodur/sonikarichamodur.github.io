Mr. Chen Cheng is a research scientist at Xinjiang University in the College of Information Science and Engineering, located in Urumqi, China. Due to his experience with training machine learning models, including classification algorithms, on mushroom datasets, I gained valuable insight from him relating to my project such as:

- The importance of conducting feature selection on the data, which was a step not previously included in my experimental design.
- Caps and stalks are very important features in the data, because they contain more proteins and medicinal value in mushrooms. 
- All algorithms are not an ideal fit for all data, which makes it a wise decision to train many classification algorithms on the data. For example, he stated that I could train a classifier using Support Vector Machine as well.
