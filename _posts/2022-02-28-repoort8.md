 I have curently been intepreting and acting on the advice that Dr. Asha Gowda gave me in an interview I had with her. Details of our interview can be accessed <a href=https://sonikarichamodur.github.io/2022-01-28-report6>here.</a>

Instead of working on the k-means algorithm like originally planned, I am now working running the k-modes algorithm. The k-modes algorithm will not generate a graph as previously proposed in my experimental design, but will display centroids that can give me an insight on how my binary classifiers are classifying mushrooms in my dataset.  

First, I learned k-modes was not part of scikitlearn and needed to be installed from Python's pip like so:

Then, I ran the k-modes algorithm on the dataset. I began by running it without the Elbow Method and choosing an arbitrary number of clusters.

- `verbose` means the output will describe the procecesses more.
- `n_init` means the number of times the k-modes algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. 
- `Huang` means the kmodes method described by Huang in 1997 and 1998 will be used. 
- `n_clusters` means the number of clusters to form.

The verbose output was condensed into the following  results:

- Run 1 cost: 49750.0
- Run 2 cost: 54324.0
- Run 3 cost: 56293.0
- Run 4 cost: 49750.0
- Run 5 cost: 50146.0

I printed out the centroids generated from the clustering algorithm trained on the dataset.

The best run was number 1, whose four cluster centroids were the following:

Specifics on the mushrooms these centroids represent can be accessed <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l-lhi-i6gmZuEC3aQ1a7KjRhMCZ3P7QfUkZHY-ISQOk/edit?usp=sharing>here.</a>

These centroids are an average observation for their respective clusters. Therefore, the two centroids labelled as poisonous show, <b>on average,</b> what groups of traits likely result in a poisonous mushroom.

Likewise, the two centroids labelled as edible , <b>on average,</b> what groups of traits likely result in an edible mushroom.

Conclusion/ TL;DR: A mushroom with attributes that most closely match centroids 1 and 2 is likely to be classified as poisonous by my model, and a mushroom with attributes that most closely match centroids 3 and 4 is likely to be classified as edible by my model. 

Note that these results are just ballparks and not exact! 

I am currently working on seeing if I could use the Elbow Method to run k-modes clustering on the optimal number of clusters.
