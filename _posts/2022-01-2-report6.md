Recently, I conducted a Zoom meeting with Dr. Maitreyee Dutta, head of the computer science department at National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research, also called NITTTR in Chandigarh, India.

Her research paper was about the classification of mushrooms using machine learning algorithms, namely the ANFIS algorithm (Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). 

My meeting with her can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R5dHR0xCfMqjKcm2LJldb3vuW84l2ZHk/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>
