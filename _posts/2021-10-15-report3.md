I presented the content on this website in the format of a slidedeck and gained helpful feedback from my mentor and research classmates. I used the feedback I recieved to adjust the amount of background I gave for my project, and I learned from my mentor that it would be helpful to include a visualization of my dataset, as I have done so in my <a href="https://sonikarichamodur.github.io/design/">experimental design.</a> I figured out how important it was to address the significance behind my project, which made me think of how my machine learning model can be a resource for poison control centers in addition to being a tool for pharmacologists to identify mushrooms safe to make medicines from.
