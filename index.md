### The goals with this research are to: 
 
- Build a **binary classifier** that can take the attributes of a mushroom as input and output whether the mushroom contains toxic chemicals or not.
 
- Use **clustering analysis** to identify combinations of mushroom attributes that are more likely to indicate toxicity.
 
_This research has impacts in cutting-edge pharmacology and saving lives by helping poison control centers._

Due to its anticancer properties and prevalence in alternative medicine, pharmacologists are working to **extract beta glucans from nontoxic gilled mushrooms to develop modern medicine**. Pharmacologists are on the lookout for species of gilled mushrooms whose beta glucans are more easy to extract, and a mushroom toxicity classifier could help them narrow their research when exploring the estimated _2-3 million unidentified mushroom species._
 
## <font color="#E34000">Poison Control</font>
 
A vast majority of the human population fervently forage for gilled mushrooms due to its valuable medicinal properties, albeit the formidable toxicity risks.
**Identifying the existence of toxic chemicals in gilled mushrooms is difficult for humans, as there are no rules of thumb to abide by.** Therefore, _machine learning models_ for determining the presence of toxic chemicals in Agaricaceae fungi are at the verge of becoming an indispensable tool for poison control centers
