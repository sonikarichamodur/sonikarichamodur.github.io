## <font color="#E34000"><b>What are "gilled" mushrooms?</b></font>
*to address a common misconception, they are indeed <b>gilled</b> mushrooms and <u>not grilled</u> mushrooms.*
<ul>
  <li><b>Agaricaceae</b> is the family of fungi containing gilled mushrooms.</li>
  <li><b>All</b> mushrooms we know of are <b>gilled</b> mushrooms, <u>except</u> chanterelles.</li>
  <font color="#4980e6"><i>Note: chanterelles are nontoxic, so they do not need to be in the scope of the research.</i></font>
</ul>

## <font color="#E34000"><b>What makes a mushroom toxic?</b></font>
A toxic mushroom contains at least one of the following seven toxic chemicals: <font color="#4980e6"><b>amatoxins, gyromitrin, muscarine, ibotenic acid, muscimol, psilocybin, and orellanine</b></font>. Specifically, amatoxins are a subgroup of 9 toxic compounds with a similar chemical structure--alpha amanitin, beta amanitin, and gamma amanitin are the significant ones for mushrooms. <font color="#6b9207"><b>The classifier to be built in this research will predict the overall presence of these toxic chemicals.</b></font>
