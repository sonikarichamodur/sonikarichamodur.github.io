## <font color="#E34000"><b>What are "gilled" mushrooms?</b></font>

*to address a common misconception, they are indeed <b>gilled</b> mushrooms and <u>not grilled</u> mushrooms.*
<ul>
  <li><b>Agaricaceae</b> is the family of fungi containing gilled mushrooms.</li>
  <li><b>All</b> mushrooms we know of are gilled mushrooms, <u>except</u> chanterelles.</li>
</ul>

{: .box-note}
**Note:** Chanterelles are nontoxic, so they do not need to be in the scope of the research.
