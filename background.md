## <font color="#E34000"><b>What are "gilled" mushrooms?</b></font>

*to address a common misconception, they are indeed <b>gilled</b> mushrooms and <u>not grilled</u> mushrooms.*
<ul>
  <li><b>Agaricaceae</b> is the family of fungi containing gilled mushrooms.</li>
  <li><b>All</b> mushrooms we know of are <b>gilled</b> mushrooms, <u>except</u> chanterelles.</li>
</ul>

**Note:** Chanterelles are nontoxic, so they do not need to be in the scope of the research.

## <font color="#E34000"><b>What makes a mushroom toxic?</b></font>
A toxic mushroom contains at least one of the following seven toxic chemicals: <font color="#E34000"><b>amatoxins, gyromitrin, muscarine, ibotenic acid, muscimol, psilocybin, and orellanine</b></font>. Specifically, amatoxins are a subgroup of 9 toxic compounds with a similar chemical structure--alpha amanitin, beta amanitin, and gamma amanitin are the significant ones for mushrooms. <font color="#6b9207"><b>The classifier to be built in this research will predict the collective presence of these toxic chemicals.</b></font>

## <font color="#E34000"><b>What gives mushrooms its anticancer properties?</b></font>

Each of the two hexose sugars pictured below is a beta-d-glucose monosaccharide, and when bonded together by 1, 3 or 1, 6 glycosidic bonds,represented by the dashed lines, they make up beta-d-glucose polysaccharides, known as the beta glucans present in mushrooms.

These glycosidic bonds are unique to mushrooms and give its beta glucans the capability to suppress and prevent cancerous tumors. The insoluble nature of such beta glucans makes pharmacologists want to extract them from mushrooms to use in medicine (Barbosa et al., 2019).
